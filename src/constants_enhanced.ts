    "If your business were a person walking into a networking event, how would they act and speak? Describe their personality as if you're describing a friend.",
    
    // Messaging Phase (3-5)
    "If you had to explain what makes your business special in one short sentence, what would you say? Try to capture both what you do and why customers should care.",
    "When you talk about your business, do you tend to be more casual and friendly, or more professional and formal? Write a few lines about your business in this style to see how it sounds.",
    "Look at your website, social media, and any marketing materials. Are you telling the same story everywhere? Note any places where your message differs.",
    
    // Audience Phase (6-8)

    // Question 1: Why choose your business?
    "Most AI companies rush to market with black-box solutions that work until they don't. We're different - every system we build is interpretable and has built-in safety guardrails. While others promise magic, we deliver AI that businesses can actually trust and understand. Our mission: make AI adoption safe for companies who can't afford catastrophic mistakes. We're not trying to replace human judgment, we're amplifying it with transparent, reliable automation that grows with your business.",
    
    // Question 2: Three guiding principles
    "Safety Before Speed: Every model goes through extensive testing scenarios, including adversarial inputs. We document failure cases and edge case handling before deployment. Interpretability Always: Our clients get plain-English explanations for every AI decision. Monthly reports show exactly how the system arrived at recommendations, no black boxes. Human-Centered Design: Regular check-ins with end users. AI suggests, humans decide. Built-in override capabilities and clear escalation paths when the system encounters uncertainty.",
    
    // Question 3: Business personality
    "Thoughtful listener who asks clarifying questions before offering solutions. Dressed professionally but approachably - think startup founder, not big tech executive. Explains AI concepts using relatable analogies instead of technical jargon. The person who stays engaged when others talk about their challenges, genuinely curious about how automation could help without overselling. Would follow up with relevant case studies, not generic sales pitches."
  ],
  messaging: [
    // Question 1: One-sentence explanation
    "We build AI systems that businesses can actually trust - transparent, safe, and designed to augment human decision-making rather than replace it.",
    
    // Question 2: Communication style
    "Professional but accessible - we avoid both AI hype and overly technical language: 'AI doesn't have to be scary or mysterious. We build systems that show their work, explain their reasoning, and give you confidence in every recommendation. No black boxes, no unpredictable behavior - just reliable automation that makes your team more effective while keeping humans in control of important decisions.'",
    
    // Question 3: Message consistency
    "Website emphasizes safety and interpretability strongly. LinkedIn posts sometimes focus too much on technical achievements, less on business value. Sales materials consistently highlight human-centered approach. Gap: case studies show impressive results but could better explain our safety methodology. Email nurture sequence needs more content addressing AI adoption fears and ROI concerns."
  ],
  audience: [
    // Question 1: Favorite customer type
    "Operations leaders at mid-sized companies who've been burned by overhyped tech solutions before. They value thorough vetting over flashy demos. Want to innovate but need to justify ROI and risk management to stakeholders. Appreciate vendors who understand regulatory constraints and the importance of explainable decisions in their industry.",
    
    // Question 2: Customer problems
    "Problem 1: Fear of AI unpredictability - worried about system failures, biased outputs, or decisions they can't explain to customers/regulators. Problem 2: Resource constraints - need AI benefits but lack ML expertise to evaluate solutions or manage complex implementations. Problem 3: Stakeholder buy-in challenges - difficulty convincing leadership that AI investment is worth the risk, especially after hearing AI horror stories in the news.",
    
    // Question 3: Message relevance
    "Content addresses safety concerns well but could better tackle the 'AI is too complex for us' worry. Recent posts focus on technical capabilities but miss the resource constraint angle - need more 'white glove implementation' messaging. Stakeholder buy-in challenge barely addressed in current materials. Should create more content around business cases, risk mitigation frameworks, and executive-level ROI discussions."
